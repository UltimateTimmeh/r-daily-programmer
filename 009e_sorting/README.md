Sounds like a great opportunity to educate myself about sorting algorithms. I vagely remember their
existence from my first year of university, but I never really went deep into the subject. This
challenge will allow me to implement several algorithms, and perhaps even test which ones are
more efficient for smaller lists and which ones are more efficient for larger lists.
