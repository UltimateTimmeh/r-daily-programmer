## Development notes

I once again decided to go the object-oriented route. Actually, from now on I will always try
to do that, since it's what Python was designed for. So from now on I will only explicitly
mention when I go for the functional route. A new thing for me in this challenge is that I have
made the script executable from a terminal. The command for printing the song's lyrics on a
single line, starting at 99, is:

    user@host:~$ /path_to_script/beerbottles.py 99 ' '

Challenge complete!
