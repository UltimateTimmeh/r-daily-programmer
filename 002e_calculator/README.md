## Description

Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs,
so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your
life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be something that you can use in
the classroom.

For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a `F = M * A` calculation.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to
calculate `F = M * A`, but also `A = F/M`, and `M = F/A`!

## Development notes

There is a lot of room for expansion here. I could, for example, add all formulas for
length, surface and volume of basic geometrical shapes. However, I don't think it's
worth it. The TextMenu class could be useful in the future though. This challenge is
complete.
