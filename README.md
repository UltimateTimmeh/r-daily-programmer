## Introduction

My repository for solutions to the challenges posted on [the /r/DailyProgrammer subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer).
All programming is done using python 3.x, and I will attempt to always make all my code as pythonic as
possible. If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to send me a message!
